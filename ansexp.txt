So before beginning I would like to make it clear that I have assumed that the egg in question is a chicken egg as anything else doesn't make sense.

Let's roll back the years shall we..the first ever egg to appear on the face of the earth was laid by an animal whose genes genetically differed very little from what we know today as a chicken..the parents' genes mixed in a way to produce a slightly altered/mutated form  of the same..this was known to be the chicken..

The chicken must have come first as the formation of eggs is only possible thanks to a protein found in the chicken’s ovaries.The protein – called ovocledidin-17 (OC-17) – acts as a catalyst to speed up the development of the shell.

I think with some common sense and scientific facts to back me up I've put the argument to bed..and with this the defence rests xD
